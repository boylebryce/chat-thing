# chat-thing

## Description

This is a school project for CS401 - Software Engineering. This project will be a simple chat room / messaging system using a client-server model. The project will allow users on the client side to create an account, join a chat room, and send messages in that chat room. The server will maintain each chat room and forward messages from clients in a chat room to all other clients in the same chat room. The server will use a database to maintain user accounts, chat rooms, and chat room message histories. The client application will present controls to create an account, log in, select a chat room, view the chat room's message history, and send messages.This chat would make a smoother communication for people. Broadcast general notifications, such as user logins and logouts. Also, be able to send private messages between two users.
